## Developer Log - Postalot


### February 10-15

Houston is in a bit of bad luck. The temperatures are freezing, power is out, water is rationed, but work continues. I have begun work on the app and have made a logo,
a name, and a purpose. I've also set up the main systems to run the application, and created the godly "For" loop that fetches all the data and displays it, 
and there is no surprise here- I know most of my work will take place inside of this loop.

Included here is a small gif of the support so far. As one scrolls, more images show. The dog is just for reference, but I have set up a video player as well.

Spent an hour or two setting up Firebase API. It's pretty simple, and I took a lot of the code from another Project I was working on. Also just cloned that other
Project's Firebase. It's pretty simple having a template, and I hope somebody will use this as a template someday as well.

Made the Github today, and I fixed a disgruntling Canvas Bug just by anchoring some UI components. Now, the app displays perfectly on all phones, regardless of 
resolution. I plan to spend some more time today working on functionality, and choosing random images/videos from a list of users followed, then marking the content 
as seen somehow to not see it again.
